Subject: Urgent Variation Request for Product 'ReguloX' (PL 12345/0001)

Hi Team,

Following our discussion, please initiate a variation for our product ReguloX (PL 12345/0001).

The change involves an update to the formulation of the finished product. Specifically, we are replacing an existing excipient. This falls under a minor change category.

Please process this as a Type IB variation, specifically code IB-C.II.a. The affected SPC section is 6.1.

Let me know if you need anything further.

Best,
John Doe
